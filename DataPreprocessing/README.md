# Data Preprocessing

The data underwent preprocessing steps in Python using Pandas to ensure its readiness for analysis. These steps included:

* Data exploration to understand the data structure and identify potential issues.
* Data cleaning to address missing values and outliers:
    * Missing values were imputed in the Smoking Status and BMI columns using appropriate strategies.
    * Outliers were handled in the Glucose Level and BMI columns based on data analysis.
* Dropping irrelevant columns and renaming others for clarity.

For detailed information on the data preprocessing steps and the rationale behind each decision, refer to the document: [Data Preprocessing Details](https://github.com/yashaharshika/Predictive-Analysis/blob/main/DataPreprocessing/Data%20Preprocessing.pdf).

# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The SVM models were developed in Python to address the predictive task for brain stroke. Since, the dataset contains data imbalance issue, following analysis is performed:

* **Undersampling**: Reducing the majority class to match the minority class size to train the SVM model.
* **Oversampling**: Increasing the minority class using techniques like SMOTE to match the majority class size to train the SVM model.

# Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)

The FNN models were developed in Python to address the predictive task for brain stroke, particularly handling the data imbalance issue. The FNN analysis included the following steps:

* **Undersampling**: Reducing the majority class to match the minority class size to train the FNN model.
* **Oversampling**: Increasing the minority class using techniques like SMOTE to match the majority class size to train the FNN model.

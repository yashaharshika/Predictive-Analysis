# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed in Python using various libraries to understand the dataset and uncover patterns and relationships. The EDA included the following steps:

* Data visualization to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential issues.
* Univariate analysis to explore the distribution of individual variables.
* Bivariate analysis to examine the relationships between pairs of variables.
* Multivariate analysis to investigate the interactions between multiple variables.

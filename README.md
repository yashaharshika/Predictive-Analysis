# Predicting Brain Stroke

## Research Question

This study aims to assess the predictive capability of demographic and health-related variables in determining the probability of an individual experiencing a brain stroke.

## Implementation

To solve this, we have followed the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data.

3. **Prediction Algorithms**:
   - **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
     - Implemented various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke.
   - **Deep Learning Algorithms**:
     - Explored the use of deep learning techniques for prediction.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
